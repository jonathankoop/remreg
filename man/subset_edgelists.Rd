\title{Subset Multiple Edgelists}
\usage{
subset_edgelists(edgelists, m)
}
\arguments{
\item{edgelists}{A list of edgelists. Each edgelist should be a data frame
with at least the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{time}: The time of each event.
\item \code{actor1}: The identifier of the first actor involved in the event.
\item \code{actor2}: The identifier of the second actor involved in the event.
}}

\item{m}{An integer specifying the number of rows to retain in each edgelist.}
}
\value{
A list of edgelists, where each edgelist has been subset to contain only
the first \code{m} rows.
}
\description{
This function subsets each edgelist in a list of edgelists to include only
the first \code{m} rows.
}
\details{
The \code{subset_edgelists()} function is useful for processing multiple relational event histories (REHs) by truncating them to a specified number of events.
This is particularly helpful when comparing or analyzing event histories of different lengths.

The function iterates through each edgelist in the input list and subsets it
using standard R subsetting (\verb{[1:m, ]}).
}
\note{
The function assumes that each edgelist in the input list is a data frame
with at least the columns \code{time}, \code{actor1}, and \code{actor2}. If an edgelist
contains fewer than \code{m} rows, the entire edgelist is returned.

\examples{
# Example edgelists
edgelists <- list(
  data.frame(time = 1:10,
             actor1 = sample(1:5, 10, replace = TRUE),
             actor2 = sample(1:5, 10, replace = TRUE)),
  data.frame(time = 1:15,
             actor1 = sample(1:5, 15, replace = TRUE),
             actor2 = sample(1:5, 15, replace = TRUE))
)

# Subset each edgelist to the first 5 rows
subsetted <- subset_edgelists(edgelists, 5)

# View the subsetted edgelists
print(subsetted[[1]])
print(subsetted[[2]])
